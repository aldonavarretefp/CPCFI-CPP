# Tabulation recipe
<ul>
    <li>Visualize the problem as a table</li>
    <li>Size the table based on the <i>inputs</i></li>
    <li>Initialize the table with default values: Choosing compatible types (if you are asked to return a number you should fill the table with numbers, Likewise if boolean)</li>
    <li>Seed the trivial answer into the table, the rest will depend on this value: (Fib: case 0,1) (Grid Traveler:1x1 grid)</li>
    <li>Iterate through the table (the hardest part)</li>
    <li>Fill further positions based on the current position</li>

</ul>
